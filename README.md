# OTP Verification System

This is a Python-based OTP (One-Time Password) Verification System. It generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user's email address for verification. The project uses the `smtplib` library to send emails and `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- Generates a 6-digit random OTP.
- Sends the OTP to the user's email address.
- Provides a simple GUI for email input, OTP sending, and verification.
- Verifies the OTP entered by the user.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. Required Python libraries: `smtplib`, `email`, `tkinter`, and `random`. These are part of Python's standard library, so no additional installation is needed.
